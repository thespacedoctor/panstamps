.. note::
    If working with warped PS1 images then you need to work off a machine that has an IP address whitelisted by the `Pan-STARRS1 data archive <https://panstarrs.stsci.edu/>`_, otherwise only stacked images will be available to you. Also *w*-band images are not (yet) accessible from the data archive.
